    I started with Html in 2018, learnt how to modify  few things on a webpage.<br>
    my zeal died down months later. <em>fast-forward!</em> 2020 was the re-birth.<br>
    Here i am in 2021 fully re-invigorated, Stackademic leading me by the hands.<br>

  <h4><strong>DRIVING FORCE</strong></h4>
  <p> I thrive when there's competition or motivation.<br> When I feel like giving up, I remember how far I've come, I just need to <strong>PERSEVERE</strong><em> I say to myself.<br></em> keep putting efforts, knowing that quiting is not an option.<br> Learnig 
everyday should be on my front burner, bearing in my mind that i might not necessarily be the best, However I am going to <strong>SUCCEED.</strong></p>
